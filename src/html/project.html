        <p>The goal of the website was to make companies using the website feel a more personalised experience, i.e if you are a food company, 
        the website would be orientated around such a premise</p>
        <br>
        <p>Due to the outstanding product that I presented to the cohort of the company, my product was

        to take tests and have feedback on their tests.</p>

        you must choose between calming or feeding your dinosaur</p>
