    <div class="column-kiyanpay">
        <p>This website was created during my month-long internship at KiyanPay (now known as kixy).
        The goal of the website was to make companies using the website feel a more personalised experience, i.e if you are a food company, 
        the website would be orientated around such a premise.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here are some of the things i did during my time in the company:</p>
        <br>
        <p>• Contributed to internal market research by examining other competitors and making a study on it, in
        addition I participated in quality assurance of other UX designs. </p>
        <br>
        <p>• Designed a new layout and a new business page for the company, by using Figma alongside following the
        company's UX guidelines.</p>
        <br>
        <p>• Due to the outstanding product that I presented to the cohort of the company, my product was
        shortlisted with all the other engineers proposals, alongside achieving a bonus cash prize.</p>

    <div class="column-weather">
        <p>This website was built with a team in university in my year 2</p>
        <br>
        <p>This application is designed for cyclists. The main goal of the app was to give the user 
        all the information needed about the weather with a quick glance, as a cyclist would require information quick when cycling.
        APIS were used to fetch the weather information - and boilerplate was used (pReact)</p>

      <div class="column-exam">
        <p>This exam system was designed and created with a group, with each member completing a certain class, 
        my job was to work on one of the 3 main classes - the trainee. This system was awarded and picked as one of the top 5 best projects by the uni.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The system consists of 3 main users :</p>
        <p>• The administrator creates trainees and trainers</p>
        <p>• The trainer which creates tests and marks tests</p>
        <p>• The trainee which actually the takes the tests</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the system the trainee is able to take a test and enrol on certain modules, 
        once the tests are complete they are then able to review the feedback for the exam they completed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This projects main goal was to create a complicated system with many functions using javascript - css and styling was not the main focus.</p>
